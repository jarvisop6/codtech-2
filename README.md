intership project on Library Management System 
Library Management System
This is a simple Library Management System built in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to perform basic library operations such as:

Displaying available books
Borrowing books from the library
Returning borrowed books
Features:
Display Available Books: Users can view a list of all books currently available in the library.
Borrow a Book: Users can borrow a book, and the system will remove it from the list of available books.
Return a Book: Users can return a borrowed book, which will be added back to the list of available books.
The system is user-friendly and operates through a simple command-line interface. It's ideal for beginners looking to understand basic object-oriented programming concepts in Python.

How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Run the Python script: python library_management_system.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system.
